# Amusement-Park-Network-Design
The main aim of this project is to design a prototype network system for Amusement Parks
in Cisco Packet Tracer tool. 

The network is divided into 5 separate network pools.
- WLAN Group  
- Rides Group
- Stalls Group
- Admin Group
- Server Group

Five Servers have been setup in this prototype design.
- DHCP Server:
Automatic IP Addresses should be assigned to every section of users
according to their designated Subnets. But, Devices inside Server rooms
should be assigned static IP addresses.
- DNS Server:
Two main A Records should be included in DNS records, one for the email
server and another for the website’s server.
- Web Server:
Amusement Park’s main website should be hosted on this web server, where
all the necessary details should be given to everyone.
- Email Server:
An internal email service for users of Rides, Stalls & Admin sections of the
network.
- FTP Server:
Needed for file transfer for Rides, Stalls and Admin sections. Admin sections
should have all the ac-cess of the files, while Rides & Stalls users should only
be able to Read the files. WLAN users cannot use it.

Subnetting for the network:

You will need the CISCO PACKET TRACER tool to open the .pkt file.
